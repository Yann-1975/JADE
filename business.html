      <article class="project">
        <h3>3) Restaurant Digital Transformation (Problem-Solving Page)</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project Architect & Lead</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A traditional restaurant needed to improve customer engagement, streamline bookings and modernize communication channels.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution & Outcome:</strong> Designed and implemented a responsive web experience (see the Problem-Solving page) including social media integration, contact details and an interactive booking/feedback form that generates emails for staff. Outcome: modern UX, faster booking flow, and integrated social presence.</p>

        <h4>Design concept behind the Problem-Solving page</h4>
        <p>
          The Problem-Solving page was structured to satisfy the business needs: quick access to contact, integrated social proof, and a booking flow that requires no backend (uses mailto pre-filled emails).
          This provides a low-cost, fast-to-deploy solution for small hospitality businesses while enabling easy analytics tracking and progressive enhancement into a full booking system later.
