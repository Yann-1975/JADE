<h1>Business Showcase</h1>

<h2>Project 1 – Restaurant Digital Transformation (Problem-Solving Page)</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> CTO / Web Developer</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The restaurant needed a digital solution to improve customer engagement, 
streamline bookings, and modernise communication.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I designed a structured web-based solution featuring integrated social media,
contact details, and an email-generating interactive form. The design focuses on simplicity,
customer experience, and supporting the restaurant’s transformation goals.</p>

<h3>Design Concept Explanation</h3>
<p>
The “Problem-Solving Page” is intentionally simple, accessible, and efficient. 
Its structure includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A business context introduction outlining goals.</li>
    <li>Social media integration for improved engagement.</li>
    <li>Contact information for transparency and trust.</li>
    <li>An interactive form that generates email requests without a database.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This structure supports smooth user interaction while aligning with the restaurant’s 
digital transformation needs.
</p>

<h2>Project 2 – Technology Innovation Strategy (TechSphere Group)</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> Head of Technology & Innovation</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The company needed a roadmap for adopting emerging technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I led the development of an innovation strategy now used to guide 
team structure, project priorities, and investment decisions.</p>

<h2>Project 3 – Cloud Migration Initiative (NovaEdge Technologies)</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> CTO</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Legacy systems were limiting scalability and security.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I led a cloud transformation programme improving performance, 
system reliability, and data security across the company.</p>
